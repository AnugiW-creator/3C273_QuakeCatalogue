# 3C273_QuakeCatalogue
Hi! We're 3C 273, a team of students from Queen Mary and KCL, and we're excited to share our submission to NASA Space Apps this year with you!

Below is a guide to the files in this repository:

Manual_detection: Adaptation of demo code used to manually detect arrival times. Mostly implemented on training data due to time constraints.

NSAC_trial_code : A machine learnining algorithm using Neural Networks to predict the arrival times of the Moonquakes. Start training the Network with the datasets.
